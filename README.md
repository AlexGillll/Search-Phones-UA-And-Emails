# SearchPhonesUAAndEmails

Working with regular expressions and the clipboard on the principle: 
CTRL + C, running the program -> executing the program (through regular expressions collects data from the buffer: phone numbers and emails adress.) -> displays and throws in the buffer exchange.



## This project was created for personal purposes to save time on routine work.
When I worked as a quadcopters sales manager, I had to copy each customer's phone number and paste it into a Google spreadsheet. It took too much time and was of no use. So, it was decided to use libraries with regular expressions (re) and the clipboard (pyperclip).
This code perfectly saves time of 30 minutes for 10 seconds. ;)
